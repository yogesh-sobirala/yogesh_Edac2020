<p>1- Har ishq ka ek waqt hota hai. Woh humara waqt nahi tha, par iska ye matlab nahi ki woh ishq nahi tha.

2- Hum sainkadon janam lete hain. Kabhi pati-patni bankar, kabhi premi bankar, toh kabhi anjaane bankar. Lekin milte zaroor hai aakhir mein. Nahi milenge toh kahani khatam kaise hogi ? Ise pyar kehte hain. 

3- Nawazish, karm, shukriya, meherbani. Mujhe baksh diya aapne, zindagani!

4- Sabhi insaan ek jaise hi toh hote hai. Wahi do haath, do paun, aankhen, kaan, chehra. Sabke ek jaise hi toh hote hai. Phir kyun koi ek, sirf ek aaisa hota hai, joh itna pyara lagne lagta hai ke agar uski liye jaan bhi deni padhe, toh haste haste di ja sakti hai.

5- Duniya ke sitam yaad, na apni hi wafaa yaad. Ab kuch bhi nahi mujhko mohabbat ke sivah yaad. 

6- Sharaab peene de masjid mein baithkar,  ghalib, ya woh jagah dikha de jahan khuda na ho.

7- Mohabbat reet rivaaz nahi maanti, aur na hi woh lafzo ki mohtaj hai.

8- Bekhabar soye hai woh loot ke woh neendein meri, jazba-e-dil pe taras khane ko jee chahta hai. kabse khamosh hue ho jaane jahan kuch bolo, kya abhi aur sitam dhane ko jee chahta hai?

9- Jaane se pehle, ek aakhri baar milna kyun zaroori hota hai?

10- Yeh mulk toh meri maa hai, aur Mumbai shehar meri mashooka!</p>
